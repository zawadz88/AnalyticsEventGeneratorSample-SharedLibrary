## AnalyticsEventGeneratorSamples

Contains samples for [AnalyticsEventGenerator](https://github.com/zawadz88/AnalyticsEventGenerator) project.

In this repository there's a library that uses the AnalyticsEventGenerator plugin to generate events from YAML files and send
them to a sample backend.

The library artifacts are published to Github Packages (Maven & NPM) and as a Cocoapod so that it can be used by
separate Android, iOS & Web projects. These projects are all in this repository for simplicity,
but in a real world project it would make more sense to have them in separate repositories.

You can find the instructions on how to build and run the sample apps in READMEs in each subdirectory.
